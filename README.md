# Haxe OpenApi client codegen

This project is at the very beginning so probably nothing works

I am not from the Java world so many things might be done in the wrong way.
Advices/PRs on how to do something right or better much appreciated.


## Useful commands
### Project stub under `core` is generated using following command
`openapi-generator-cli meta -o core/ -n HaxeCodegen -p com.haxe.codegen`
`openapi-generator-cli` must be in your PATH in order to execute this command. (See [OpenApi documentation](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator#launcher-script))

See `README.md` inside `core/` to find additional useful commands
